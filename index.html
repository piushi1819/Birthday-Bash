        <p>I hope this day brings you as much joy as your presence has always brought into my life. Though things have changed between us, my feelings for you remain steadfast, and I can't help but cherish all the memories we've shared.</p>
        <p>You are such an incredible personâ€”beautiful, kind, and inspiringâ€”and Iâ€™m so lucky to have known you. I miss you more than words can express, and I still love you deeply. My heart quietly wishes for a chance to be by your side again, but above all, I want your happiness, whether thatâ€™s with me or not.</p>
        <p>Have an amazing day filled with love, laughter, and everything you deserve. Youâ€™ll always hold a special place in my heart. ðŸ’–</p>
